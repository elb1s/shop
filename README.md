<h1>Space Shop</h1>
<hr>
Space Shop is an e-commerce platform
where customers can purchase products.
<br></br>
In this project, I utilized a public API to retrieve
products and implemented functionality for
listing, adding to a cart, and displaying product
details. I also used a custom hook to fetch data
from the public API.
